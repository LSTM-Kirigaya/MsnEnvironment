# MsnEnvironment
A new pybullet-based gym style simulator, which is a reconstruction of my previous dummy project

Compared to the prevous version, I have integrate a more easy-used version here. And the task is expanded to a discrete version and continuous version, which are named as `MsnDiscrete` and `MsnContinuous` respectively. I recommand you to use stable-baseline to train your model in the simulator directly, which cost little time to code. Then, you can focus more on the process method of your algorithm. Fine, if you wanna implement a brand-new DRL algorithm on the system, you'd better implement your training system.

> HaHa, in fact, I am just in my mood and reconstruct the project in one night. So, you know, this is not complete. Just wait until end of the weekend.

What's more, I use a more reasonable method to specify the parameter in the reward function. I recommand you to take an insight into the distribution of the different component of the reward.

More caption will be stated here when the reconstruction is accomplished.
